    <p>If you're not my mom, get off this website.</p>
    <p>I knew just the way to thank you instead of a plain old card because, let's be real, who wants JUST a card? I had to level it up this year because doing the same thing each year is kind of repetitive. I was like "I KNOW! How about an ENTIRE website?" I couldn't fit everything i wanted to say in a puny little card! I hope you have as much fun exploring this website as you do on your birthday. Just to get started, i'll name a few things that make you GREAT;</p>
    <p>You're funny, You're fun, You're comforting,  You're cheerful, You're charismatic, and SOO much more.</p>
    <p>Have fun mom. </p>
    <p><span class="love">Love</span> Matthew</p>

                <p>Here are some of the best times that wouldnt've happened without you;</p>
                <p>Turks and Caicos: BOY that was the best vacation ever. The food? Everything was free! I loved the freedom of being able to explore the different villages. Disney world: It's always SO magical when we're all there. It's just so fun, for NO reason at all! Tenesee: It was so relaxing in the mountain air up there at the cabin. Sitting in the hot tub, watching movies in the lounge, so awesome. Destin: The beach? Ohhh it was so nice. Oh and the hotel we both stayed at while andrew and dad were still at home? such a good time.</p>
                <p>Thank you for all those times..</p>
